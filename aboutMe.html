        The Digital Voyager
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello. My name is ******. I’ve been called a storyteller, writer,
        photographer, digital nomad, instagrammer, social entrepreneur, solo
        traveller, vegan and environmentalist. But in my heart, I’m just a nomad
        who believes in the transformative power of travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011, at age 23, I quit my 9-to-5 corporate job with a dream of
        travelling the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2013, I gave up my home, sold most of my belongings and began living
        nomadically.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2015, I turned vegan and decided to cut out all animal products from
        my diet and lifestyle, realizing that it’s better for the animals, the
        planet and my own body.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, I co-founded Voices of Rural India – a novel, not-for-profit
        platform that creates digital storytelling opportunities for rural
        communities affected by the tourism shutdown following Covid-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2021, I began to pivot into sustainable tourism consulting and
        research, aspiring to work with DMOs, governments, businesses and
        non-profits to meet their environmental and social impact goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2022, I joined the Work For Humankind project and spent a month on
        one of the world’s remotest islands – Isla Robinson Crusoe, 700 km off
        the coast of Chile – working on renewable energy, community farming and
        conservation storytelling projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in slow and sustainable travel, embracing local ways of life,
        spending time with local communities, exploring places off the beaten
        path and minimizing my environmental impact.

        My Journey
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a protective Indian family in Dehradun, a valley at the
        base of the Himalayas, and spent my childhood wondering what lay beyond
        the mountains I could see from my rooftop. Upon finishing high school, I
        went to Singapore to study, with big dreams and a big student loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As luck would have it, I graduated in the middle of the financial
        recession of 2009, when most companies I wanted to work with had ceased
        hiring. I landed a job with the Singapore Tourism Board, where my
        experiments with social media began, and I first began following the
        journey of travel bloggers around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was impossible to tame my restless cubicle-bound soul, so in 2011, I
        took a 2 month sabbatical from work. I went flash-packing across Western
        Europe with a friend, and volunteer-travelled by myself in the high
        Himalayas of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those two months, I saw, experienced and lived more than I ever had
        before, and decided to quit my first and only corporate job with a dream
        of travelling the world on my own terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2014, the story of how I quit my job to travel was featured on BBC
        Travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017, I was featured on the cover of National Geographic Traveller
        India magazine!
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2018, I was awarded silver for best writing in a travel blog at TBC
        Asia Awards.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019, my work was featured on The Washington Post, among travellers
        changing the way we think of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, I won gold for best communicator at the WTM Responsible Tourism
        Awards India.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2021, I was featured among 15 travel trailblazers by Travel + Leisure
        India and South Asia.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2022, I was named among 30 Global Champions of Environmental
        Sustainability in Hospitality and Tourism at the Global Hospitality
        Awards.

        How I Like To Travel
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not a backpacker. While I carry a convertible backpack for
        convenience, I like to stay in experiential accommodations (Airbnbs,
        homestays), seek local experiences and don’t believe in counting every
        penny I spend. I like to go slow, get under the skin of a place, spend
        time with locals and experiment with the local cuisine; here’s how I
        survive and thrive as a vegan traveller. I mostly travel solo or with my
        partner; group travel with a fixed itinerary is just not for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that our travel choices have an impact on the places we visit.
        On my part, I try to contribute to the local economy, prefer public
        transport, avoid plastic bottled water and other single-use plastic, say
        no to unethical animal attractions, consume no animal products, prefer
        to eat what grows in the region, ask for permission before photographing
        people and try to form my own opinions of the places I visit and the
        people I meet.

        What I'm up to now
      </p>
      <p>
        The on-going pandemic has brought the global tourism industry to a halt.
        In 2020, I was to speak at The Economic Times Women’s Forum in India and
        at an environmental conference in Uzbekistan. I had dreamt of going back
        to Iran and travelling overland to Azerbaijan. All my travel plans were
        cancelled – and I learnt to be grateful for the small joys life still
        affords us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, I began to work with tourism businesses to measure their
        environmental impact and design community-led tourism projects, develop
        what I call ‘collaborative community storytelling’ (working with
        community members to co-tell travel stories), and further my knowledge
        and skills in sustainability and environmental management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently looking for long term, slow travel assignments that allow
        to me to tell stories at the confluence of conservation, communities and
        climate change – as well as design impactful sustainable tourism
        initiatives.
