      Travel Experiences in India
    </h1>
    <p>
      It's already the end of the year, and when I look back on 2021, the
      traveller in me can't help but wish that I had explored more. If only I
      had taken the last minute trip to Mashobra to watch the snow fall or
      extended my weekend getaway to Goa into a workation, I'd be over the moon!
      I did unlock a number of travel milestones, but in this world that's so
      big and beautiful, no amount of travelling is enough. So for 2022, to keep
      my travels more streamlined, experiences in India that I need to have next
      year and so should you!

      Mountaineer in Himalayas
    </p>
    <img src="./images/tent-travel-exp.jpg" alt="" class="images" />
    <p>
      The Indian Himalayan region has always pulled in adventurers from all over
      the world. From legends to mountaineers of 21st century using skills and
      techniques to climb several summits have motivated several amateurs to
      follow their footsteps. I’m not a mountaineer but have met couple of them
      and heard stories. Peak climbing is now a demanding part of adventure
      tourism in India. Some of the notable peak climbing tours are Stok Kangri,
      Kang Yatse and Lungser Kangri in Ladakh; Black Peak, Pangarchula Peak,
      Rudragaira Peak in Garhwal; and Mt. Ladakhi, Friendship peak and Mt. Deo
      Tibba in Himachal Pradesh.

      Lonavala: Trekking experience
    </p>

    <img src="./images/lonavala-card-img.jpg" alt="" class="images" />
    <p>
      Located approximately 106 km away from Mumbai, the hill station of
      Lonavala is known for the spectacular beauty of the green valleys that
      surround it. While there are umpteen things to do here, this list will
      give you an idea about the best things to do in Lonavala. What you can’t
      miss during your trip to Lonavala are Bhaja Caves and Karla Caves. Both of
      them are popular Budhhist shrines visited by thousands of tourists every
      year. Featuring intricate sculptures, these caves are considered to be the
      next best to those at Ajanta and Elora. You will also get an opportunity
      to experience the Bhushi Dam which often overflows during the monsoon
      seasons.

      The OOty Experience
    </p>

    <img src="./images/ooty-img-exp.jpg" class="images" />
    <p>
      Ooty is a nice place to enjoy for honeymoon couples. I went to Ooty in the
      month of September. Eventhough the time is rainy season, fortunately my
      trip went without any rain. We get down at Mettupalayam from Chennai by
      Nilgiri Express. From there we got a steam train, which went through so
      many beatiful natural scenes, whhcih can't forget in my life time. That
      much greenary it is because of rainy season. So many Waterfalls on the
      way. The train will stop in some stations in between to enjoy the nature.
      Every one can get down and have a nice breeze near by waterfalls. Finally
      we arrived in Ooty by that steam train. After that we have reached a Form
      House Inside in the outskirts i.e. inside the Nilgiri Hills. Where they
      are providing Accommadation with food and also transportation for trips
      nearby. First time i experienced the snow fall inside that hills which i
      never seen before. Ofcourse until 9 o'clock we can't come out of the room
      because of cold. After that around 11, we have started and visited near by
      beatiful and natural forests where u only be there.

      Goa Experience
    </p>

    <img src="./images/goa-exp-img.jpg" class="images" />
    <p>
      One must visit goa in moonsoon season for greenery, cool weather.
      Sometimes it is raining and again suddenly stops and rain. We had fun
      time. North goa has many places to visit compare to south goa. But still
      both places offers fun<br />

      Most of the beaches we have visited. More than temples and churches.<br />

      The only thing keep in mind is if someone want to come goa for waterrides
      at beaches then a big NO to them in moonsoon season. Since there is no
      water ride activities happen at beaches in rainy season. It is strictly
      restricted by tourism. Forts and jungle trips on your own risk.<br />

      Transportation mode is good, bus and autos are budget transport mode,
      taxis are bit expensive.<br />

      Food is awesome both veg and sea food.<br />

      Shopping is not much and again need to mention, open markets are closed
      during moonsoon season which is july-September end.<br />

      Everywhere bargaining is important whether it is hotel accomodation or
      shopping.<br />

      Overall it is relaxed fun trip. Great scenic with greenary and river trips
      are awesome to visit goa. You will feel refreshed after goa visit.<br />
